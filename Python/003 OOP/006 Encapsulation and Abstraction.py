Encapsulation

Encapsulation is one of the most fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). This is the concept of wrapping data and methods that work with data in one unit. This prevents data modification accidentally by limiting access to variables and methods. An object's method can change a variable's value to prevent accidental changes. These variables are called private variables.

Encapsulation is demonstrated by a class which encapsulates all data, such as member functions, variables, and so forth.

Abstraction

Abstraction is used to hide the internal functionality of the function from the users. The users only interact with the basic implementation of the function, but inner working is hidden. User is familiar with that "what function does" but they don't know "how it does."

In simple words, we all use the smartphone and very much familiar with its functions such as camera, voice-recorder, call-dialing, etc., but we don't know how these operations are happening in the background.

In Python, an abstraction is used to hide the irrelevant data/class in order to reduce the complexity. It also enhances the application efficiency.
